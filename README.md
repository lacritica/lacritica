# Development Site for La Crítica Del Derecho

Está basado en el template de [Darin Dimitroff](https://twitter.com/deezel), [spacefarm.digital](https://www.spacefarm.digital).

## Local Development

Clone this repository, and run `yarn` or `npm install` from the new folder to install all required dependencies.

Then start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Testing

With the development server running, run the tests locally
with `yarn cypress:run` or `npm run cypress:run`.
Or use `yarn cypress:open` or `npm run cypress:open` to run interactively.

Cypress tests also run on deploy with the [Cypress Netlify integration](https://www.netlify.com/integrations/cypress/).

## Layouts

The template is based on small, content-agnostic partials that can be mixed and matched. The pre-built pages showcase just a few of the possible combinations. Refer to the `site/layouts/partials` folder for all available partials.

Use Hugo’s `dict` functionality to feed content into partials and avoid repeating yourself and creating discrepancies.

## CSS

The template uses a custom fork of Tachyons and PostCSS with cssnext and cssnano. To customize the template for your brand, refer to `src/css/imports/_variables.css` where most of the important global variables like colors and spacing are stored.

## SVG Social Icons

The social media icons are in `site/assets/img`.
Make sure you use consistent icons in terms of viewport and art direction for optimal results.
For an icon named `icons-facebook.svg`, refer to the SVG `social-icon` partial like so:

```
{{ partial "social-icon" (dict "link" "#" "svg" "icons-facebook" "alt" "Kaldi on Facebook") }}
```
